# Vite + React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

## Install

`pnpm` is recommended as the package manager.

```
pnpx degit choutianxius/vitecn
```

## Quick Start

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Deploy

See [vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)

## Add a Component

> [!CAUTION]
> The Shadcn CLI doesn't work now because a TailwindCSS configuration file is required, which is deprecated in TailwindCSS v4.

See [shadcn/ui docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)

The button component has been added since I assume it's going to be used by most projects.

```shell
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```
